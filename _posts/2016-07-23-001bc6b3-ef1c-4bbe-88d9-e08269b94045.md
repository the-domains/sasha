# Title Summary of Election Analyses

<article style=""><h1>Summary of Election Analyses</h1><p>A few pieces of election analysis, within the year after the election</p></article>

Main article

[Summary of Election Analyses][0]

A few pieces of election analysis, within the year after the election:

* [USIP Peace Works report][1] published November of 2014
* Two pieces from the Journal for Democracy (about five months after election):[Technology is not Democracy][2] (Barkan) and [Choosing Peace over Democracy][3] (Long)
* A piece from _before_ the election on the [high chance of violence][4] by the same Joel Barkan, writing for CFR.
* [July analysis from the International Crisis group][5].
* Also from July: [What to Read on Kenyan Politics][6]

All are written by foreigners associated with academic institutions or think tanks, and noted a number of inconclusive or unexplained findings -- which I think the average informed Kenyan could take a stab at answering. Common sentiment and word on the street could at least point to some answers.  
Bonus: here's one interesting analysis from closer to the election:

[The Kenyatta Affair][7]

What Kenya and its allies can learn from Austria's Nazi legacy. In Foreign Policy, by James Verini (who seems better at comparative historical than firsthand account election coverage)
